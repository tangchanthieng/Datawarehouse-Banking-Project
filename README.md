### 1. Project Overview

This project aims to design and implement an end-to-end analytics solution for Aurora Commercial Bank (Aurora Bank) by transforming raw operational data into meaningful business intelligence. The solution will demonstrate the complete analytics lifecycle, including data ingestion, data warehousing, ETL development, data quality management, SQL analysis, Python-based analytics, and interactive reporting through Power BI. The project is built using four operational datasets provided by the bank:

- Users Data
- Cards Data
- Transactions Data
- Merchant Category Codes (MCC)

These datasets will be integrated into a centralized SQL Server data warehouse using a **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze → Silver → Gold). The curated data will then be analysed to provide insights into customer behaviours, transaction patterns, financial health, and sales/merchant performance.

### 2. Business Background

The commercial bank offers a variety of financial products including savings accounts, credit cards, debit cards, and payment services. Every customer interaction generates transactional data that is valuable for understanding spending patterns and customer engagement. The bank currently maintains separate datasets for:

- Customer information
- Card information
- Financial transactions
- Merchant Category Code (MCC) reference data

Although these datasets contain rich operational information, they have not been integrated into a unified analytical environment. **Senior management has identified several business challenges:**

- Customer profitability is difficult to measure.
- Spending behaviour is not fully understood.
- Merchant category performance cannot be easily analysed.
- Card usage trends are difficult to monitor.
- Operational reporting requires significant manual processing.

To address these issues, the bank has commissioned the development of a centralized data warehouse and business intelligence solution.
